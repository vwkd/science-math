# Law Of Large Numbers



## Introduction

sample mean of identically distributed, randomly generated variables approaches theoretical mean as their number increases

average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists
 
given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean.

only applies to average of the results obtained from repeated trials and claims that this average converges to the expected value
it does not claim that the sum of n results gets close to the expected value times n as n increases.

if you repeat an experiment independently a large number of times and average the result, what you obtain should be close to the expected value.
given enough attempts, results will tend towards expected averages.

The more you sample, the truer your sample mean is to the average mean of the population.
as you take more samples, the average of the samples will get closer to the true value.

If you do something that is subject to random chance a lot of times, the observed average outcome will converge on the theoretical average outcome.

mean of samples of same random process will tend towards the true mean, as you take more samples.

The average of many independent samples is (with high probability) close to the mean of the underlying distribution.
This density histogram of many independent samples is (with high probability) close to the graph of the density of the underlying distribution.
average of a lot of independent samples from a random variable will almost certainly approach the mean of the variable.
