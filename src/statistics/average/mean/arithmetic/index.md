# Arithmetic



## Introduction

- midpoint on linear scale
- value at equal distance between values on linear scale

$$ \bar{x} := \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} $$

- beware: often called mean, average!
- median in arithmetic progression, e.g. 5 in 3, 5, 7
- used when values don't differ widely
