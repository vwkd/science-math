## Introduction

average of a set of numerical values
nth fraction of the sum of n numbers

midpoint of numbers
What is equally far from a and b?
We want to go from a to b in two steps, each step is an addition by the same number
m-a = b-m

midway between the two numbers
m + m = x + y

when added to itself n times gives sum of numbers

average on linear scale
midpoint between two values on linear scale
