# Geometric



## Introduction

central number in a geometric progression
e.g. 9 in 3, 9, 27
nth root of the product of n numbers

$$ x = \sqrt(a) $$

 finding a value in between widely different values.
 when we want to compare things with very different properties.

We want to go from a to b in two steps, each step is a multiplication by the same number
m/a = b/m

length of the side of a square/... whose area is the same as the area/volume of the rectangle/... with sides

use for taking the average of ratios, e.g. yearly rates
  equivalent rate if each rate was the same
e.g. average growth rate

when multiplied by itself n times gives product of numbers

smaller than an arithmetic mean of the same non-negative real numbers

average on log scale
midpoint between two values on log scale

regular arithmetic mean of the logarithms and interpreting that as a logarithm
