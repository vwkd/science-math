# Ergodicity



## Introduction

- intuitive notion of randomness

mathematical description of a dynamical system which, broadly speaking, has the same behavior averaged over time as averaged over the space of all the system's states (phase space)

average of process parameter over time and average over statistical ensemble are same

An even statistical distribution of probabilities, where the system returns to every possible state an infinite number of times

observable's ensemble average equals the time average
any collection of random samples from a process represents the average statistical properties of the entire regime

time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average
time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time "forgets" its initial state
time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space

time averages of various functions along trajectories of deterministic dynamical systems

a point of a moving system will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense
  (moving system: a dynamical system or a stochastic process,)
the average behavior of the system can be deduced from the trajectory of a "typical" point
a sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process
the system cannot be reduced or factored into smaller components

any representative point of the system eventually comes to visit the entire volume of the system

time spent by system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, over long periods of time
all accessible microstates are equiprobable over a long period of time
