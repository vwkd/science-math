# Ergodic hypothesis



## Introduction

expectation value reflects what happens over a long time
is wrong
only true under special conditions in which quantities are ergodic
  not growth processes, not growing quantities
  may be possible to construct observables whose time averages equal their expectation values
    e.g. growth rates
